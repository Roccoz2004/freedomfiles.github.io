I am now opening the project up for public use, including my database of various files. The Guns CAD and 3D print files for the manufacture of firearms and firearm parts at home. Can't Stop the Signal. The Books Books and PDFs pertaining to freedom, liberty, and chaos.  The Piracy Software that is kept behind a paywall, subscription based, or adware, now made free and hosted here. I also include a list of open-source software that are helpful and completely free to use."}]
